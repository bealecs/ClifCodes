# Clif Codes

### Journey to Freelance

Programming, not just web development, has been a passion of mine since I was a child. I have been coding since my early teen years, however I have shifted my main focus since seperating from the military. My goal has been to become a web developer, which I have done an amazing job at, personally speaking. 

I received some advice from a mentor recently that I needed to stand out from the other applicants in my job search in order to get anywhere. This is when I felt the need for a shift. I love what I do, however I do not love the competetive nature of finding a job doing what I love. I feel that there is an unnecessary anxiety and hopelessness brought about with the overall competetiveness of the job market right now. With that being said, I figured it was time to take matters into my own hands.

After completing several of my own projects, releasing a portfolio, and then creating a large scale, full-stack application ... I was still no closer to finding work than I was before. The difference, however, is that I am now stacked with all of these amazing skills that I have picked up and have been dying to show off. I am so excited to engage with clients, give consults, and be the boss of my own work environment. I have never taken on a challenge like this, and I am excited to see where this road leads me and my work in the future.

This repository will serve as the landing page for the Clif Codes freelancing site. Here will be my personal contact information, as well as demonstrations of previous works, what technologies and stacks I am proficient with, and a calendar set up to schedule 1:1 consultations with me about work.

This landing page will be a static, single-page application using React and Next-js.
